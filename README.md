# Instagram with HTML & Sass
An Instagram clone using Sass instead of CSS.

Let's start with some theory about SCSS and Sass.

## Theory in SCSS/Sass

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>What is SASS? What does SASS stand for?</li>
        <p><abbr title="Syntactically awesome style sheets">SASS</abbr> stands for Syntactically awesome style sheets</p>
    <li>What is a CSS pre-processor?</li>
    <p>It is a scripting language that extend the default capabilities of CSS, by giving tools regular CSS doesn't have, like variables, nesting, etc.</p>
    <li>What does a pre-processor have to do with SASS?</li>
      <p>A pre-processor is useful because it can help with the maintenance of CSS in medium-large sites, by giving the tools that can help building, editing, and organising the files and the code itself.</p>
    <li>Why use SASS?</li>
      <p><ul> 
        <li>It's CSS syntax friendly</li>
        <li>It offers variables for whatever you want</li>
        <li>It uses nested syntax</li>
        <li>It includes mixins </li>
        <li>You can divide and conquer (file and code organization)</li>
        <li>It has a large community and is well documented</li>
        <li>If you know SASS, you can customize Bootstrap 4 (and beyond)</li>
      </ul></p>
    <li>SASS has disadvantages? Which are?</li>
      <p><ul> 
        <li>The developer must have enough time to learn new features present in this preprocessor before using it.</li>
        <li>Using Sass may cause losing benefits of browser's built-in element inspector.</li>
        <li>Code has to be compiled.</li>
        <li>Difficult Troubleshooting.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <li>What is a SASS Variable? Explain why are useful</li>
      <p>Variables in Sass are like in any other programming language, a tool to store values and use them in different places. With that in mind, the application of that on styles are limitless, and really interesting.</p>
    <li>Explain the SASS variables property with an example.</li>
      <p>An example of a SASS variable could be: <code>$primary-color: #fafafa</code>. This variable can be called as a parameter of any of our styles later, avoiding to write unnecesary code, and making it easier to change recurrent values in every place they are used.</p>
    <li>What is a mixin? Why is it important? Give an example</li>
      <p>The tools of @mixin and @include makes it easy to re-use chunks of styles. Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet. They make it easy to avoid using non-semantic classes and to distribute collections of styles in libraries.</p>
    <li>What is SCSS? Give an example</li>
      <p>Answer</p>
    <li>What is SASS? Give an example</li>
      <p>Answer</p>
    <li>What is the difference between .scss and .sass syntax.</li>
    <p>In Sass syntax we use  indentation rather than brackets. The SCSS syntax is full compliant with CSS' syntax.</p>
    <li>In which cases would we use SCSS? And in which cases would we use SASS?</li>
      <p>Answer</p>
    <li>Explain how traditional CSS and Preprocessed CSS workflows are different.</li>
      <p>In the preprocessed CSS you will always need to make a compilation before its use. By the atomization of the code in smaller files, the workflow is also affected in consciously divide the code, but, when is needed to review or change, it will be more accesible and easy to work with.</p>
    <li>Can we create functions with SASS? If it is true, give an example.</li>
      <p>Answer</p>
    <li>What is nesting? Is it useful? Give an example of nesting</li>
      <p>Answer</p>
    <li>Difference between @use & @import? Give an example</li>
      <p>Answer</p>
    <li>How can we import other CSS/SASS files in SASS? Give an example</li>
      <p>Answer</p>
    <li>Explain the concept of inheritance in SASS.</li>
      <p>Answer</p>
    <li>Why use @extend? Give an example</li>
      <p>Answer</p>
